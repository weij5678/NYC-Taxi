# Results

In this section, we present the key results from the dimension reduction analysis and visualizations to understand the factors influencing tipping and FHV ride trends.

## 1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

### a. The Important Principal Components
The first two principal components consistently explain a significant portion of the variance (around 46-48%)

- **Visualization**:

- **Interpretation**:
  The Screeplot above clearly shows... 


### b. Analyzing the Variables within the Principal Components
We found that the first two principal components consistently explain a significant portion of the variance, but now we see weather variables are most correlated with the first principal component

- **Interpretation**:
The Barplot above clearly shows...


### c. Principal Component Regression
Since we found that the first two principal components explain,

## 2. Canonical Correlation Analysis

### a. Visualizing Cross-Correlation 
The first two principal components consistently explain a significant portion of the variance (around 46-48%)

- **Visualization**:
<img src="images/FullScreeplot.png" alt="drawing" width="600"/>

- **Interpretation**:
  The Screeplot above clearly shows... 


### b. Visualizing the Canonical Covariates
The first two principal components consistently explain a significant portion of the variance (around 46-48%)

- **Visualization**:
<img src="images/FullScreeplot.png" alt="drawing" width="600"/>

- **Interpretation**:
  The Screeplot above clearly shows... 


### c.Overall correlation Structure
The first two principal components consistently explain a significant portion of the variance (around 46-48%)

- **Visualization**:

- **Interpretation**:
  The Screeplot above clearly shows...

## 3. Visualizing Pickup/Dropoff Locations

### a. Pickup Location Trends
The first two principal components consistently explain a significant portion of the variance (around 46-48%)

- **Visualization**:
<img src="images/FullScreeplot.png" alt="drawing" width="600"/>

- **Interpretation**:
  The Screeplot above clearly shows... 


### b. Dropoff Location Trends
The first two principal components consistently explain a significant portion of the variance (around 46-48%)

- **Visualization**:
<img src="images/FullScreeplot.png" alt="drawing" width="600"/>

- **Interpretation**:
  The Screeplot above clearly shows...
