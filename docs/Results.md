## 1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

### a. The Important Principal Components
The first two principal components consistently explain a significant portion of the variance (around 46-48%)

- **Interpretation**:
  The Screeplot above clearly shows...

### b. Analyzing the Variables within the Principal Components
We found that the first two principal components consistently explain a significant portion of the variance, but now we see weather variables are most correlated with the first principal component
