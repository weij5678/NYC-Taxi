## Overview
This project explores how weather conditions influence taxi or For-Hire Vehicle (FHV) ride-hiring patterns in New York City from 10/15/2023 to 11/15/2023. I aim to visually analyze clusters of pickups across different zones and time periods, examining how weather factors such as temperature, precipitation, and wind affect FHV demand.

## Data Description
- **Source**: 
- **Variables**: Average temperature, precipitation levels, etc.

## Methodology
- **PCA**: Reduces the dimensionality of the dataset while preserving as much variance as possible.
- **MDS**: Provides a two-dimensional visualization of the distances between states based on climate variables.

## Results
The key findings are visualized through scatter plots and heatmaps, demonstrating the clustering of states by climate patterns.

## Conclusions
Key takeaways and future exploration
