# US Metropolitan Weather Project

## Overview
This project explores relationships between climate variables using multivariate statistical methods such as PCA and MDS. The dataset includes temperature, precipitation, wind speed data for 200 major cities in the US from 2020.

## Data Description
- **Source**:
- **Variables**: Average temperature, precipitation levels, etc.

## Methodology
- **PCA**: Reduces the dimensionality of the dataset while preserving as much variance as possible.
- **MDS**: Provides a two-dimensional visualization of the distances between states based on climate variables.

## Results
The key findings are visualized through scatter plots and heatmaps, demonstrating the clustering of states by climate patterns.

## Conclusions
Key takeaways and future exploration
